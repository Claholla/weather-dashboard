# weather-dashboard

This application allows the user to search by city name and accesses the Open Weather Map API. It loads up to date weather information on the searched location and it provides a glance of the future weather for that location with a 5-day forecast. The user inputs are saved in a visible button array as a history and the user is able to switch between previously searched locations through the history buttons.
